[C] [a] [G] [F]

Loving can [C]hurt
Loving can [a]hurt sometimes
But it's the [G]only thing that I know[F] 

When it gets [C]hard
you know it can get [a]hard sometimes
it is the [G]only thing that makes us feel ali[F]ve

[a]We keep this love in a photog[F]raph
[C]We made these memories f[G]or ourselves
where our [a]eyes are never closing
our h[F]earts are never broken
and t[C]ime's forever frozen s[G]till

{Refren}
So you can [C]keep me inside the pocket of your
[G]ripped jeans holding me close until our
[a]eyes meet, you won't ever be al[F]one
Wait for me to come home[C] 

Loving can [C]heal
Loving can m[a]end your soul
And it's the [G]only thing that I know, [F]know

I swear it will get [C]easier
remember that with every pie[a]ce of ya
And it's the [G]only thing we take with us when we di[F]e

[a]We keep this love in a photog[F]raph
[C]We made these memories f[G]or ourselves
where our [a]eyes are never closing
our h[F]earts are never broken
and t[C]imes forever frozen st[G]ill

{Refren}
So you can [C]keep me inside the pocket of your
[G]ripped jeans holding me close until our
[a]eyes meet, you won't ever be [F]alone
And if you [C]hurt me that's ok baby, only
[G]words bleed inside these pages you just
[a]hold me and I won't ever let you [F]go

Wait for me to come h[a]ome
Wait for me to come h[F]ome
Wait for me to come h[C]ome
Wait for me to come h[G]ome

{Refren}
Or you can f[C]it me inside the necklace you got when you were
[G]sixteen next to your heart beat where I
[a]should be, keep it deep within your s[F]oul
And if you [C]hurt me well that's ok baby, only
[G]words bleed inside these pages you just
[a]hold me and I won't ever let you [F]go

And when I'm a[C]way I will remember how you
[G]kissed me under the lamppost back on s[a]ixth Street
hearing you whisper through the p[F]hone
Wait for me to come h[C]ome
