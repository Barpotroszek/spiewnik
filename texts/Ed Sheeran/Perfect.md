I found a [G]love for [e7] me 
Darling, just d[C9]ive right in
And follow my l[D]ead [Dsus4]  
Well, I found a g[G]irl
Beautif[e7] ul and sweet
Oh, I never kn[C9]ew you were the someone
Waiting for m[D]e  [Dsus4]  

'Cause we were just kids
When we f[G]ell in love
Not knowing wh[e7] at it was
I will not g[C9]ive you up this t[G]i__[D]_me [Dsus4]  

But darling, just [G]kiss me slow
Your heart is [e7] all I own
And in your [C9]eyes you're holding m[D]ine [Dsus4]  

{Refren}
Baby, [e7] I'm d[C9]ancing in the d[G]ark
With y[D]ou between my [e7] arms
B[C9]arefoot on the gr[G]ass
L[D]istening to our f[e7] avorite song
When you s[C9]aid you looked a m[G]ess
I whispered [D]underneath my br[e7] eath
But you h[C9]eard it
Darling, y[G]ou look p[D]erfect tonight

G G/F# [e7]  [Dsus4] [C9] [Dsus4]

Well, I found a w[G]oman
Stronger than [e7] anyone I know
She shares my dr[C9]eams I hope that someday
I'll share her h[D]o__[Dsus4]___me
I found a l[G]over
To carry m[e7] ore than just my secrets
To carry l[C9]ove
To carry children of our [D]own [Dsus4]  

We are still kids, but we're s[G]o in love
Fighting ag[e7] ainst all odds
I know we'll b[C9]e alright this t[G]i__[D]_me [Dsus4]  

Darling, just h[G]old my hand
Be my girl, I'll b[e7] e your man
I see my f[C9]uture in your [D]eyes [Dsus4]  

{Refren}
Baby, [e7] I'm d[C9]ancing in the d[G]ark
With y[D]ou betw[Dsus4]een my [e7] arms
B[C9]arefoot on the gr[G]ass
L[D]istening t[Dsus4]o our f[e7] avorite song
When I s[C9]aw you in that dr[G]ess
Looking so b[D]eautif[Dsus4]ul
I d[e7] on't des[C9]erve this
Darling, y[G]ou look p[D]erf[Dsus4]ect tonight

[G] [e7]  [C9] [D] [Dsus4]

{Refren}
Baby, [e7] I'm d[C9]ancing in the d[G]ark
With y[D]ou betw[Dsus4]een my [e7] arms
B[C9]arefoot on the gr[G]ass
L[D]istening t[Dsus4]o our f[e7] avorite song
I have f[C9]aith in what I s[G]ee
Now I know [D]I have m[Dsus4]et an [e7] angel in p[C9]erson
And sh[G]e looks p[D]erf[Dsus4]ect
I d[C9]on't deserve this
Y[D]ou l[Dsus4]ook perfect to[G]night
