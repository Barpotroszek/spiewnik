# Set fire to the rain
## Adele


[d] [F] [C] [g]

I let it f[d]all, my he[F]art,
And as it f[C]ell you rose to cl[g]aim it.
It was d[d]ark and I was [F]over,
Until you k[C]issed my lips and you s[g]aved me
My h[d]ands they're str[F]ong,
but my kn[C]ees were far too w[g]eak,
St[d]and in your [F]arms
without f[C]alling to your f[g]eet,

{Refrain:}
But there's a s[d]ide to you that I n[g]ever knew, I never knew.
All the th[d]ings you'd say, they where never true, never true,
And the gBames you'd play, you would [C]always, always win.

{Chorus:}
But I set f[d]ire to the rain,
Watch it p[C]our as I touched your face,
well it b[g]urn while I cry,
Cause I heard it screaming out your n[d]ame, your n[C]ame!

{Verse:}
When l[d]aying with y[F]ou
I could st[C]ay there,
Cl[g]ose my eyes, feel you're h[d]ere forever,
You and m[C]e together, nothing is b[g]etter!

{Refrain:}
Cause there's a sBide to you that I n[g]ever, never knew,
All the th[d]ings you'd say they where never true, never true,
And the gBames you'd play, you would [C]always, always win.

{Chorus:}
But I set f[d]ire to the rain,
Watch it p[C]our as I touched your face,
well it b[g]urn while I cry,
Cause I heard it screaming out your n[d]ame, your n[C]ame!
I set f[d]ire to the rain
And I threw [C]us into the flames
And it f[g]elt something die,
Cause I knew that that was the last t[d]ime, the last t[C]ime!

{Bridge:}
Sometimes BI wake up by the dF/Aoor,
That heart you c[a]aught, must be waiting f[C]or you,
Even thBat when we're already F/Aover,
I can't h[a]elp myself from looking f[C]or you

{Chorus:}
I set f[d]ire to the rain,
Watch it p[C]our as I touch your face,
well it b[g]urn when I cry,
Cause I heard it screaming your n[d]ame, your n[C]ame
I set f[d]ire to the rain,
And I threw [C]us into the flames
Well, I f[g]elt something die,
Cause I knew that was the last t[d]ime
The last t[C]ime, oh!
[d]Oh, n[C]o  Let it b[g]urn!
[d]Oh[C], no  Let it b[d]urn!
[C] Let it b[g]urn[d]! [C]
