# Rolling in the deep
## Adele


[a]There's a fire starting in my heart,
[F]Reachin[G]g a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark
[a]Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
Go ahead and sell me out and I'll lay your ship bare.
See how I leave, with every piece of you
Don't underestimate the things that I will do.
[a]There's a fire starting in my heart,
[G]Reaching a fever pitch and it's bringing me out the dark

[F]The s[G]cars of your love, remind me of us.
[e]They k[F]eep me thinking that we almost had it all
[F]The [G]scars of your love, they leave me breathless
[e]I ca[E]n't help feeling...

{Ref:}
[a]We c[C]ould have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
[F]Roll[G]ing in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[a]Your [C]had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
[F]And y[G]ou played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


[a]Baby I have no story to be told,
[E]But [G]I've heard one of you and I'm gonna make your head burn.
[a]Think of me in the depths of your despair.
[E]Maki[G]ng a home down there, as mine sure won't be shared.
[F]The[G] scars of your love, remind me of us.
[e]They [F]keep me thinking that we almost had it all
[F]The [G]scars of your love, they leave me breathless
[e]I can[E]'t help feeling...

[a]We co[C]uld have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
[F]Roll[G]ing in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
[a]Your [C]had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
[F]And [G]you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)

[a]We co[C]uld have had it all
[F]Roll[G]ing in the Deep
[a]Your had my heart Inside of your hand
[G]And you played it To the beat

[a]Throw yourself through ever open door (Whoa)
Count your blessings to find what look for (Whoa-uh)
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
And pay me back in kind- You reap just what you sow.

[a](I wis[C]h you... Never had met me)
[F]We c[G]ould have had it all (Tears are gonna fall... Rolling in the deep)
[a]We co[C]uld have had it all yeah ( I wish you... never had met me)
[F]It all. (Tears are gonna fall)
[G]It all, It all (Rolling in the deep)
